First year doing advent of code. Will be doing it in rust. Repository structure is modeled after
[Chris Biscardi's solution repsository](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code/tree/main/2023/rust)

Year two. Still rust. Same template as last year. I'm doing this as long as I find it fun and not much longer.
These problems are often quite interesting and aren't just DSA stuff which makes doing them fun since
they're mostly puzzles that aren't just "do you know xyz algorithm and can implement it for this problem"?
The difficulty does ramp quite a bit after around the first half so we'll see if I don't just give up again...
